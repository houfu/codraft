description: End-to-end example of assembling a mutual NDA with Codraft
---

This walkthrough shows how to prepare a completed mutual non-disclosure agreement using the bundled Bonterms NDA template.

## The Template

The `Bonterms_Mutual_NDA` example template is a standard mutual NDA with placeholders for party names, dates, and governing law.

## Step 1: Open Codraft in Cowork

Open Claude Cowork with your Codraft project folder. You should see the Codraft skill available.

## Step 2: Start the Interview

Tell Claude:

> "I need to prepare a mutual NDA"

Claude will find the `Bonterms_Mutual_NDA` template and begin the interview.

## Step 3: Answer the Questions

Claude will ask for values grouped logically:

**Parties**
- Disclosing party name (e.g., "Acme Pte Ltd")
- Disclosing party address
- Receiving party name (e.g., "Beta Corp")
- Receiving party address

**Agreement Terms**
- Effective date
- Governing law (e.g., "Singapore")

## Step 4: Confirm and Render

After all values are collected, Claude shows a summary for review:

```
Disclosing party: Acme Pte Ltd
Receiving party: Beta Corp
Effective date: 15 February 2026
Governing law: Singapore
```

Confirm to render. The completed NDA is saved to:

```
output/
└── nda_acme_pte_ltd_2026-02-15/
    └── nda_acme_pte_ltd_2026-02-15.docx
```

## Step 5: Open the Document

Open the rendered `.docx` file. All placeholders are filled, formatting is preserved, and the document is ready to review, sign, and send.
