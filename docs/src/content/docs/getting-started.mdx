description: Install Codraft and prepare your first document
---

## Prerequisites

You'll need a [Claude Cowork](https://claude.ai) account.

## Installation

### 1. Download Codraft

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/houfu/codraft/releases) page and download the latest `codraft-v*.zip` file. Extract it to a folder of your choice (e.g., your Documents folder).

### 2. Open in Cowork

Open Claude Cowork and add the extracted folder as a project. That's it — Python dependencies are installed automatically the first time you use the skill.

## Quick Start

### Add a template

Create a subdirectory in `templates/` and place your template file inside:

```
templates/
└── nda/
    └── nda.docx
```

### Prepare a document

Tell Claude:

> "I need to prepare an NDA"

Claude will find the template, extract its variables, and interview you for the values.

### Get your document

After confirming all values, the rendered document is saved to a job folder:

```
output/
└── nda_acme_pte_ltd_2026-02-15/
    └── nda_acme_pte_ltd_2026-02-15.docx
```

For HTML templates, both the HTML and PDF are saved:

```
output/
└── invoice_acme_2026-02-15/
    ├── invoice_acme_2026-02-15.html
    └── invoice_acme_2026-02-15.pdf
```
