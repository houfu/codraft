description: What Codraft supports in v2 and what is planned
---

## v2 Features

Codraft v2 supports:

- **Variable substitution** — `{{ variable_name }}` placeholders with type inference from name suffixes
- **Conditional logic** — `{% if %}` / `{% else %}` / `{% endif %}` for including/excluding sections
- **Loops** — `{% for item in items %}` / `{% endfor %}` for repeating sections
- **Developer configuration** — optional `config.yaml` per template
- **Two template formats** — `.docx` (via `docxtpl`) and `.html` (via `jinja2` + `weasyprint`)
- **Skill separation** — three focused skills (Orchestrator, Analyzer, Renderer)
- **Manifest caching** — analysis is cached and only regenerated when the template changes

## v2 Constraints

- Single-level nesting only (no blocks inside other blocks)
- Two condition forms: truthiness and equality (no `{% elif %}`)
- No computed fields or expressions
- Variables are always collected from the user, never calculated

## v3 Roadmap (Planned)

- `{% elif %}` support
- Computed/derived fields
- Nested blocks (limited depth)
- Multi-template document assembly
- Web-based interview UI
